# Unit 1: Terminology

### Classes of mathematical objects we will use 
------------------------
|  | 0D domain | 1D | 2D | 3D | 4D |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0D range |a number|const line|const map|const(3D)|time independent const(3D)|
|1D  |a random variable (PDF)| y=f(x) curve | 2D scalar map| 3D scalar field | evolving 3D field|
|2D  |a 2D vector|2D vectors along a line|2D flow: **kinematics**|hor. vectors in 3D or evolving 2D flow|evolving hor. vectors in 3D|
|3D  |a 3D vector|3D vectors along a line|a plane of 3D vectors| **3D flow at an instant** | **evolving 3D flow**|
|ND  |a ND vector|matrix algebra|arrays|arrays|abstract phase spaces|


### Pure math concepts 
------------------------
| Word | Meaning | Math notation(s) | Conceptual Sketch |
|---|---|---|---|
|Function, argument, value, domain, range ||||
|First derivative|slope, gradient, tendency, velocity for pos(t)||rate of change wrt. domain variable|
|Integral|cumulative sum|(plus arbitrary constant of integration)|CDF from PDF|
|Second derivative |curvature, Laplacian, acceleration for pos(t)|*-Σ k<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> sin(k<sub>i</sub> x)* for *Σ sin(<sub>i</sub>x)*|emphasizes small scales; edge finder in imagery|
|Inverse Laplacian |cumulative cumulative sum|*-Σ k<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> sin(k<sub>i</sub>x)* for *Σ sin(k<sub>i</sub> x)*|smoothed, emphasizes largest scales|
|Mixed second derivative |saddle points, ...|||
